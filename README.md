# BuddyBuddy

‚ù§Ô∏è Inspiration

There are many community applications for young people, such as discord that we use in the university or any other dating apps. However, there is no application for elder people. However, due to the COVID, the disconnection between elders getting serious and there is a lack of opportunity to meet together. Therefore, we decided to introduce an application that is easily accessible for the elders but helps them to be connected and join the community activity whichever they would like to enjoy together.

üë©‚Äçüíª What it does

It introduces the opportunity to do the activities together, in various categories, such as exercise, arts, dance, instruments, and study. They can join together, make their own activity meeting, meet whenever and wherever they want with the people living in their community. They can even hang out to have a cup of coffee together, or eat dinner, drink a beer :) This application also introduces the news and library activities as well.

‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

We used the Flutter offered by Google, implement it on the Android studio for the android application and Xcode for the ios application. We used adobe XD for drawing the UI and implementing it on the application. Moreover, for the basic IDE, we used VS code.

üò∞ Challenges we ran into

This is the first time for us to use Flutter and Dart, but even the first time developing the application. However, after struggling to learn the Dart and the flutter for a while, we eventually get a little bit familiar with the tool and the language. However, we struggled with the backend, and we want to develop it in the future.

üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of

We eventually implement every function that we planned to implement at the beginning of the projects, and we like the UI of our applications.

üëç What we learned

We learned the basic process of app development, Flutter, Dart, Android Studio and Xcode. General process of working together for application development was great :)

üòá What's next for BuddyBuddy

Add the map to navigate in order for elders to find the location easily.
Implement the face ID, so the elders will not be required to put any information to sign in, but just their face recognition will auto generate the personal information with random ID and nickname. This will make more accessible to reduce the work to start the application.
Implement the web crawling to get the information from the library.
Offering the Auto match service using AI.
